description: "The Phoenix and the Carpet is a fantasy novel for children, written\
  \ by E. Nesbit and first published in 1904. It is the second in a trilogy of novels\
  \ that begins with Five Children and It (1902), and follows the adventures of the\
  \ same five children: Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane and the Lamb. Their mother buys\
  \ the children a new carpet to replace one from the nursery that they have destroyed\
  \ in an accidental fire. The children find an egg in the carpet, which hatches into\
  \ a talking Phoenix. The Phoenix explains that the carpet is a magic one that will\
  \ grant them three wishes a day. The five children go on many adventures, which\
  \ eventually wears out their magic carpet. The adventures are continued and concluded\
  \ in the third book of the trilogy, The Story of the Amulet (1906).\n From Wikipedia\
